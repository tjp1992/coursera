    "\n",
    "It would be unwise to run all the microservices in a single **Container**, because it would be counterintuitive to have the application divided into microservices in the first place. Therefore, when an application is broken down into microservices, it is deployed in multiple **Containers** allowing each microservices to be managed separately. ***Container Orchestration*** are tools which group systems together to form clusters where container's deployment and management is automated at scale while meeting the requirements for Quality Assurance(QA) and Production environments.\n",

    "- Enable containers in a cluster to communicate with each other regardless of the host they are deployed to in the cluster.\n",
    "- Bind containers and storage resources\n",
    "- Group sets of similar containers and bind them to load-balancing constructs to simplify access to containerized applications by creating an interface, a level of abstraction between the containers and the client\n",
