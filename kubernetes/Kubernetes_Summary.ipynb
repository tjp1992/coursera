    "\n",
    "It would be unwise to run all the microservices in a single **Container**, because it would be counterintuitive to have the application divided into microservices in the first place. Therefore, when an application is broken down into microservices, it is deployed in multiple **Containers** allowing each microservices to be managed separately. ***Container Orchestration*** are tools which group systems together to form clusters where container's deployment and management is automated at scale while meeting the requirements for Quality Assurance(QA) and Production environments.\n",

    "- Enable containers in a cluster to communicate with each other regardless of the host they are deployed to in the cluster.\n",
    "- Bind containers and storage resources\n",
    "- Group sets of similar containers and bind them to load-balancing constructs to simplify access to containerized applications by creating an interface, a level of abstraction between the containers and the client\n",

    "  A Kubernetes cluster can be extended with new custom features without modifying the upstream source code.\n",
    "- Self-healing\n",
    "\n",
    "  Kubernetes automatically replaces and reschedules containers from failed nodes. It terminates and then restarts containers that become unresponsive to health checks, based on existing rules/policy. It also prevents traffic from being routed to unresponsive containers.\n",

    "  With Kubernetes applications are scaled manually or automatically based on CPU or custom metrics utilization.\n",
    "- Service discovery and load balancing\n",
    "  Containers receive IP addresses from Kubernetes, while it assigns a single Domain Name System (DNS) name to a set of containers to aid in load-balancing requests across the containers of the set.\n",

    "- Automated rollouts and rollbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "  Kubernetes seamlessly rolls out and rolls back application updates and configuration changes, constantly monitoring the application's health to prevent any downtime.\n",
    "- Secret and configuration management\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Kubernetes manages sensitive data and configuration details for an application separately from the container image, in order to avoid a re-build of the respective image. Secrets consist of sensitive/confidential information passed to the application without revealing the sensitive content to the stack configuration, like on GitHub.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  Kubernetes automatically mounts software-defined storage (SDS) solutions to containers from local storage, external cloud providers, distributed storage, or network storage systems.\n",
