    "[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) is one of the easiest, most flexible and popular methods to run an all-in-one or a multi-node local Kubernetes cluster, isolated by Virtual Machines (VM) or Containers, run directly on our workstations. Minikube is the tool responsible for the installation of Kubernetes components, cluster bootstrapping, and cluster tear-down when no longer needed. It includes additional features aimed to ease the user interaction with the Kubernetes cluster, but nonetheless, it initializes for us a fully functional, non-production, Kubernetes cluster extremely convenient for learning purposes. Minikube can be installed on native macOS, Windows, and many Linux distributions.\n",
